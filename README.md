# FIFA World Cup Database

# Description
This project was completed by Tian Xie in partial fulfillment of APAN5310: SQL& Relational Database. The project aims to benefit the hypothetical client-FIFA by creating and designing SQL database. The database generates a clear and streamlined logic in making both within-player and across-player comparisons. It will help FIFA save valuable time on the screening and processing of information.

# Goal
Create and design relational schema to load unstructured worldcup data into database for easy access and analysis. 

# About the datasets
The raw datasets are obtained from kaggle. There are a total of three datasets. The first dataset contains information about the world cup matches. It has 853 rows and 20 columns. The second dataset contains information about the players who played in the world cup. It has 37784 rows and 9 columns. Lastly, the third dataset contains information about the rankings of the participating countries in each worldcups, it has 20 rows and 10 columns. 

# Steps
1. Obtain dataset from Kaggle
2. Design normalization plans on the raw datasets.
3. Create ER diagrams using LucidChart.
4. In the transformation part of the ETL process, use python the manipulate and transfrom raw data to new tables that conform with the normalized databse schema. 
5. Load the manipulated tables from python to sql using sqlalchemy toolkit 
6. Create potential queries that FIFA would like to analyze using sql. 
7. Provide visualization of the queries to non-technical audience using metabase.
